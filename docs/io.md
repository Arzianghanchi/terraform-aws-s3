| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| arn | The ARN of the s3 bucket. |
| bucket\_domain\_name | The Domain of the s3 bucket. |
| bucket\_regional\_domain\_name | The bucket region-specific domain name. The bucket domain name including the region name, please refer here for format.

| s3\_bucket\_hosted\_zone\_id | The Route 53 Hosted Zone ID for this bucket's region. |
| s3\_bucket\_lifecycle\_configuration\_rules | The lifecycle rules of the bucket, if the bucket is configured with lifecycle rules. If not, this will be an empty string. |
| s3\_bucket\_policy | The policy of the bucket, if the bucket is configured with a policy. If not, this will be an empty string. |
| s3\_bucket\_website\_domain | The domain of the website endpoint, if the bucket is configured with a website. If not, this will be an empty string. This is used to create Route 53 alias records. |
